# Burger Creator

This app uses mySQL to store and maintain the data necessary to monitor how quickly creatively named burgers can be devoured. 

## User Experience

Users are presented with a text input bar within which they can submit the names of their most creative burgers. Names are stored as 'Ready to Eat' and Users can press the devour button at any time to see the burgers flip to the list of devoured burgers.

## Technology Used

This program is deployed in the terminal using Node, Express and Express Handlebars. Data is passed to the mySQL database through an ORM layer. On the user-side, data is rendered in the browser using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
